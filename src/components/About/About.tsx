      <p>
        I started photography in August of 2024. I am currently based in
        Austria, and I am fortunate enough be surrounded by plenty of nature and
        wildlife. Additionally, I am close to beautiful nature reserves where I
        can explore and capture the wonders of the natural world. My initial
        inspiration came from a photographer named Robert Marc Lehmann. A few
        months later, I discovered my mom s twenty-year-old camera lying around.
        It was that moment when I began taking pictures. I quickly developed a
        passion for photography, leading me to purchase my first camera just a
        few weeks later. Now, almost a year into my photography journey, I have
        dedicatet a significant amount of time capturing the wildlife of
        Austria. Photography provides me a sense of freedom and allows me to be
        present in the moment. It is a powerful outlet for my creativity, as I
        strive to capture unique pictures and moments. I thoroughly enjoy
        learning new techniques and embracing the present. While I acknowledge
        that I am still a relatively new photographer, I am very pleased with my
        progress this far. I m looking forward to continuing my photography
        journey and seeing what the future holds.
